Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction
Project Overview :
  - This project focuses on predicting hourly bike-sharing demand in an urban setting, factoring in various conditions such as weather and time of day. The goal is to optimize bike distribution, improve user satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency.

Context
  - Bike-sharing systems offer a sustainable and flexible mode of transportation in urban areas. With over 500 programs globally, they play a crucial role in reducing traffic congestion, promoting environmental sustainability, and enhancing public health. However, demand for bike-sharing      services can be highly variable, influenced by factors like weather and time of day. Accurately forecasting this demand is essential for ensuring that bikes are available when and where they are needed most.

Problem Statement
- The primary objective is to forecast the number of bike-sharing users by hour while considering weather conditions. This forecast will help in making informed decisions regarding bike distribution, maintenance schedules, and resource allocation, ultimately improving service efficiency     and user satisfaction.

Stakeholders
- Bike-sharing Company: Requires accurate demand forecasts to optimize operations and improve service delivery.
- Users: Benefit from increased availability and reliability of bikes.

Goals
- Develop an Accurate Forecasting Model: Create a machine learning model that accurately predicts the hourly demand for bike-sharing services.
- Incorporate Weather Data: Ensure the model takes into account various weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
- Optimize Operations: Use the forecasting model to enhance the efficiency of bike distribution and maintenance schedules.
- Improve User Satisfaction: Increase the availability and reliability of bikes during peak demand times and adverse weather conditions.

Dataset
The dataset includes historical bike-sharing usage data, with features such as:

    1. Temporal Features: Hour, day of the week, and whether it is a peak hour or weekend.
    2. Weather Features: Temperature, humidity, and other weather conditions.
    3. Lag Features: Previous hours' demand data to capture trends and patterns.

Model Selection and Evaluation
The project utilizes several machine learning models for prediction:
    1. Linear Regression
    2. Random Forest Regressor
    3. Gradient Boosting Regressor
    4. XGBoost Regressor

Evaluation Metrics
    1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    4. R-squared (R²)

The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance with an R² of 0.922 and was selected as the final model for deployment.

Recommendations
  - Model Deployment: Deploy the XGBoost model in a real-time environment to enable dynamic adjustments in bike availability.
  - Enhanced Feature Engineering: Incorporate more detailed weather and event data to improve prediction accuracy.
  - Error Analysis: Conduct thorough error analysis to understand prediction inaccuracies and refine the model.
  - Stakeholder Engagement: Use insights from model predictions to inform decision-making and engage with stakeholders for continuous improvement.
